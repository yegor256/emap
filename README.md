It is an alternative implementation of a map in Rust, which works much faster if the following conditions are met:

  * Keys are of type `usize`
  * Keys are used sequentially (e.g., the 5th key is inserted only when 0..4th are in the map)
  * Values implement `Copy`
  * The function `get()` is not used before `insert()`

See the [benchmarking results](#benchmark) below.

First, add this to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
emap = "0.0.1"
```

Then, use it like a standard hash map... well, almost:

```rust
use emap::Map;
let mut m : Map<&str, 100> = Map::new(); // allocation on stack
m.insert(1, "foo");
m.insert(42, "bar");
assert_eq!(2, m.len());
```

Pay attention, here the map is created with an extra generic argument `100`. This is 
the total size of the map, which is allocated on stack when `::new()` is called. 
If more than 100 keys will be added to the map, it will panic.

Read [the API documentation](https://docs.rs/emap/latest/emap/). 
The struct
[`emap::Map`](https://docs.rs/emap/latest/emap/struct.Map.html) is designed as closely similar to 
[`std::collections::HashMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html) as possible.

## Benchmark

There is a summary of a simple benchmark, where we compared `emap::Map` with
a few other Rust maps, changing the total capacity of the map (horizontal axis).
We applied the same interactions 
([`benchmark.rs`](https://github.com/yegor256/emap/blob/master/tests/benchmark.rs)) 
to them and measured how fast they performed. In the following table, 
the numbers over 1.0 indicate performance gain, 
while the numbers below 1.0 demonstrate performance loss.

The experiment was performed on 23-04-2023.
 There were 100 repetition cycles.
 The entire benchmark took 151s.
