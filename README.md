The [`emap::Map`][Map] is the fastest possible [associative array] in Rust,
  with `usize` keys.
It's by the order of magnitude faster than the standard
  [`HashMap<usize, V>`][HashMap].
It's also faster than [`IntMap`][IntMap] (_we are working on this_).

It's essentially [`Vec<Option<V>>`][Vec] with two extra features:

  1) `next_key()` with _O(1)_ complexity
  and
  2) iterators with _O(M)_ complexity, where _M_ is the number of elements in
the array.

You must know the total capacity upfront.

You must account for a memory overhead of `2 * usize` per element.

First, add this to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
emap = "0.0.13"
```

Then, use it like a standard hash map... well, almost:

```rust
use emap::Map;
let mut m : Map<&str> = Map::with_capacity_init(100); // allocation on heap
m.insert(m.next_key(), "foo");
m.insert(m.next_key(), "bar");
assert_eq!(2, m.len());
```

If more than 100 keys will be added to the map, it will panic.
The map doesn't increase its size automatically, like [`Vec`][Vec] does
(this is one of the reasons why we are faster).

Read [the API documentation](https://docs.rs/emap/latest/emap/).
The struct [`emap::Map`][Map] is designed as closely similar to
[`std::collections::HashMap`][HashMap] as possible.

## Benchmark

There is a summary of a simple benchmark, where we compared `emap::Map` with
`Intmap`, changing the total capacity `CAP` of them (horizontal axis).
We applied the same interactions
([`benchmark.rs`][benchmark])
to them both and measured how fast they performed. In the following table,
the numbers over 1.0 indicate performance gain of `Map` against `IntMap`,
while the numbers below 1.0 demonstrate performance loss.

<!-- benchmark -->
| | 4 | 16 | 256 | 4096 |
| --- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| `i ∈ 0..CAP {M.insert(i, &"Hello, world!")}` |1.14 |3.20 |1.07 |1.20 |
| `i ∈ 0..CAP {M.insert(i, &"大家好"); s ∈ M.values() {sum += s.len()}}` |1.56 |1.08 |0.47 |0.96 |
| `i ∈ 0..CAP {M.insert(i, &42); s ∈ M.into_values() {sum += s}}` |1.16 |0.91 |0.83 |0.97 |
| `i ∈ 0..CAP {M.insert(i, &42); s ∈ M.keys() {sum += s}}` |0.95 |0.71 |0.32 |0.50 |
| `i ∈ 0..CAP {M.insert(i, &42); s ∈ M.values() {sum += s}}` |1.37 |0.69 |0.85 |0.97 |
| `i ∈ 0..CAP {M.insert(i, &42)}; M.clear(); M.len();` |1.14 |3.17 |3.64 |4.69 |
| `i ∈ 0..CAP {M.insert(i, &42)}; i ∈ CAP-1..0 {M.remove(&i)}` |1.14 |3.41 |1.09 |1.22 |

The experiment was performed on 21-12-2023.
 There were 10000 repetition cycles.
 The entire benchmark took 259s.

## How to Contribute

First, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then:

```bash
cargo test -vv
```

If everything goes well, fork repository, make changes,
send us a
[pull request](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html).
We will review your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly,
provided they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration,
before sending us your pull request please run `cargo test` again. Also,
run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.

Also, before you start making changes, run benchmarks:

```bash
cargo bench
```

Then, after the changes you make, run it again. Compare the results.
If your changes degrade performance, think twice before submitting
a pull request.
