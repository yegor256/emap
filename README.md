It is an alternative on-heap implementation of a map with keys of type `usize`
and a fixed capacity. It works much faster than a standard `HashMap` 
because it allocates memory for all keys at once and then the cost
of `get()` is _O(1)_. Obviously, with this design, the cost of `iter()` increases because the iterator
has to jump through empty keys. However, there
is a supplementary function `next_key()`, which returns the next available key in the map. 
It is recommended to use it in order to ensure sequential order of the keys, which
will guarantee _O(1)_ cost of `next()` in iterators.

Also, there is an important restriction: you must not touch the keys that 
haven't been inserted yet. Thus this code is ILLEGAL:

```rust
use emap::Map;
let mut m : Map<&str> = Map::with_capacity(100); // allocation on heap
m.insert(42, "foo");
for (k, v) in m {
  // ... undefined behavior here
}
```

If `usize` keys are placed sequentially, the only true competitor of ours is 
[`std::vec::Vec`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html).
We beat it too, see the [benchmarking results](#benchmark) below.

First, add this to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
emap = "0.0.2"
```

Then, use it like a standard hash map... well, almost:

```rust
use emap::Map;
let mut m : Map<&str> = Map::with_capacity(100); // allocation on heap
m.insert(m.next_key(), "foo");
m.insert(m.next_key(), "bar");
assert_eq!(2, m.len());
```

If more than 100 keys will be added to the map, it will panic. 
The map doesn't increase its size automatically, like `Vec` does 
(this is one of the reasons why we are faster).

Read [the API documentation](https://docs.rs/emap/latest/emap/). 
The struct
[`emap::Map`](https://docs.rs/emap/latest/emap/struct.Map.html) is designed as closely similar to 
[`std::collections::HashMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html) as possible.

## Benchmark

There is a summary of a simple benchmark, where we compared `emap::Map` with
`Vec`, changing the total capacity `CAP` of them (horizontal axis).
We applied the same interactions 
([`benchmark.rs`](https://github.com/yegor256/emap/blob/master/tests/benchmark.rs)) 
to them both and measured how fast they performed. In the following table, 
the numbers over 1.0 indicate performance gain of `Map` against `Vec`, 
while the numbers below 1.0 demonstrate performance loss.

<!-- benchmark -->
| | 4 | 16 | 256 |
| --- | --: | --: | --: |
| `for _ in 0..CAP { M.push(&"Hello, world!"); }` |47.82 |99.88 |5.08 |
| `for _ in 0..CAP { M.push(&42); for s in M.into_values() { s > 0; }; }` |1.14 |0.95 |0.78 |
| `for _ in 0..CAP { M.push(&42); } for i in CAP-1..0 { M.remove(&i); }` |48.49 |101.09 |4.97 |

The experiment was performed on 25-04-2023.
 There were 10000 repetition cycles.
 The entire benchmark took 102s.
